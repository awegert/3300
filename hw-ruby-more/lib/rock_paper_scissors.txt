The rock paper scissors test was modified to allow custom error messages when
an individual inputs invalid choices. This removes the confusion I originally faced
when throwing an error with RPS in the wrong order on the .new error string. 

The rock paper scissor tests for proper hierarchy of choices and outcomes, and 
checks to make sure the first person to submit an answer in tie wins. 

The tournament testing module tests for two scenarios, a recursive set of games, 
and a non recursive set of games.
