The palindrome detection tests several things; case sensitivity, basic functionality,
and ignoring nonword characters. 

The word count tests for many things; returning of a hash, whether it works on simple
strings, ignores punctuation, works on an empty string, and ignores whitespace.

The anagram grouping tests for three things; working on empty strings, checks
that an array is returned for actual input, and provides one input to calculate.
